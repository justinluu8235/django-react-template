# django-react-template [WIP]

A template for a Django project with a React frontend. Supports the following:
1. Django backend (along with Django REST Framework)
2. React with TypeScript support
3. My preferred styling setup
4. Necessary scaffolding for elastic beanstalk deployment

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/prashanthselvam/django-react-template` and cd into the directory.
2. Create a new virtualenv using `virtualenv venv` and activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create `.env` file from the `dot-env` template with `cp dot-env .env`
5. Run `python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())â€™` to generate a dango secret key
6. Paste the generated key into the `SECRET_KEY` field in `.env`
7. Run `npm i` to install the frontend dependencies

After these steps, you should have an app that is fully ready to go. 

You can now run `./manage.py runserver` in one terminal tab and `npm run start:dev` in another to start the backend and frontend servers respectively.

## Project Structure

The Django project comes with a single app already created called `main`.

Within each app directory, you will find a `templates` directory which
hosts the HTML template(s) for that app (e.g. main/templates/index.html).
The template file is expected to have a root container which is where the
React app gets mounted.

The frontend directory is where all the frontend code goes, including the
React code. Each Django app has its own directory within `frontend/apps`
and this is where the React code lives. Our webpack config is configured
to compile the tsx files and drop them into the `dist` directory. We also
use a `publicPath` in the webpack config which is the URL at which django
finds the compiled files.


There's also a `static` directory
within the frontend directory where all other static assets can go (css,
images, etc.)
